      <p>Hey! My name is Brian Tarte. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, and lived there until I joined the Marine Corps at 19 years old. After completing my contract, I earned my BA in Criminal Justice from Chapman University, and subsequently earned my MA in Organizational Leadership. My professional background is in Supply Chain Operations, having been a leader in organizations such as Amazon and Chewy. I've been interested in code for long time, but finally made the leap into learning it this  year.</p>
